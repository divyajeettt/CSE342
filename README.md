## About CSE342

**[CSE342: *Statistical Machine Learning*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE342)** is a 3xx-level course offered to undergrads pursuing the CSAI discipline at IIIT-Delhi. The course deals with the theoretical and mathematical concepts related to classification techniques and machine learning paradigms. It aims to:

- introduce students to the key paradigms of [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [Pattern Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition), and [Statistical Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification)
- enable students to apply [Feature Extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction) and Classification techniques to solve problems
- enable students to design a complete machine learning and pattern recognition algorithm and evaluate its performance
